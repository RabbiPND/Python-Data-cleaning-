# Python-Data-cleaning-
Cleaned The Data Science Jobs on Glassdoor dataset by using python. Below are the questions that guided me through th cleaning process:
1. Can you make the salary column into integers?
2. What information can you extract out of job decriptions?
3. How can you remove the numbers from the company name?
4. How can you create some nw features? (e.g.state column from the location column)
